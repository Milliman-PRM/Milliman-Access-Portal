        File Drop roles are set within a client. This means that the roles are
        set in the Client Administration tab of MAP. To set the roles for a
        user of the client, the Client Administrator will have to navigate to the Client Administration tab, filter
        to the client by clicking the client card, and then open the user card
        in the rightmost column. The user roles contain
        <strong>File Drop User</strong> and <strong>File Drop Admin</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>File Drop User: </strong>A user that can be granted upload, download, and delete privileges by a File Drop Admin, and can manage their own settings. This role does not grant access to the File Drop activity log or the ability to manage user permissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>File Drop Admin: </strong>A user with the ability to set
          user permissions at the File Drop level for all File Drops within a Client. A File Drop Admin can also
          view the activity log for the File Drop as well as their settings.
