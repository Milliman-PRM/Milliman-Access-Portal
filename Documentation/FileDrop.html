          File drop roles are set within a client. This means that the roles are
          set in the Client Administration tab of MAP. To set the roles for a
          user of the client, navigate to the Client Administration tab, filter
          to the client by clicking the client card, and then open the user card
          in the rightmost column. The user roles contain
          <strong>File drop user</strong> and <strong>File drop admin</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>File drop user: </strong>A user who is capable of uploading,
            downloading, and deleting content (these permissions are set within
            a file drop), and can manage their own settings, but cannot view the
            file drop activity log or user permissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File drop admin: </strong>A user with the ability to set
            user permissions at the file drop level. A file drop admin can also
            view the activity log for the file drop as well as their settings.
