        Periodic review of access to each Client is required by Client Admins to ensure that access to content is limited to only those who require access.  To perform a Client Access Review, first click on the Client requiring review.  After selecting a Client, a Summary of the selected Client will be displayed which displays information on the review due date, the last review, and assigned Client and Profit Center admins. To begin the Client Access Review, click on the <strong>BEGIN REVIEW</strong> button below the summary.
