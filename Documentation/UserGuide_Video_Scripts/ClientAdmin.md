#Client Administration

This video will walk through managing clients including creating, editing, and deleting a client. We will also walk through managing users within a client including adding users, adjusting user's roles, and removing users.

## Managing Clients

### Creating a Client

To start, I will create a sample client and call it "Sample". Clicking on the plus icon to the right of the search bar of clicking on the "New Client" button will open up the form for creating a client.

Please note that not everyone who is a Client Admin can create/delete clients. Only users with "Business Authority" attached to their role of Client Admin can perform these actions. [Pop up: for questions regarding Client Administrator with Business Authority, please contact map.support@milliman.com]

There are only 2 required fields for creating a client:
- Providing a Client name. This will be what your users will see their reports under.
- A profit center. This is for billing purposes.

Additional fields that are important to fill out at the client level are approved email domain list and potentially updating the custom welcome text. The approved email domain list will include all domains that this client contains. I will put in "milliman.com" and "notadomain.com" for the purpose of this training.

The custom welcome text displays the editable portion of the email that your users will receive. We have prepopulated this for you but you are welcome to update. I am going to change this slightly for this demo.

Pressing the "Create Client" button creates the client.

### Creating a Sub Client

In order to create a sub client in MAP, you have to click on the green plus icon on the parent client card.

A new client form will open up to fill out. I will quickly fill in a few details.

Sub clients provide a way to organize your clients but the only real inheritance is email recognition from the parent client. For all other intents and purposes, the sub client is it's own client.

### Editing a Client

To edit a client, you can either click on the blue pencil on the client card, or select a card and click on the pencil in the upper right corner.

I am going to edit the Sample client and add a new domain to the list. (sampledomain.com)

Now I could add users with domains milliman.com, notadomain.com, and sampledomain.com to this client.

### Deleting a Client

To delete a client, you click on the red trash can icon on the client card.

In order to delete a parent client, there must not be any sub clients associated with the client. For this demo, I am going to delete the Sample Sub Client.

[Pop up: In order to delete a client, you must not have any content associated with the client or any users associated with the client.]

Note that you have to provide your password when deleting a client. This is to ensure you are actually wanting to move forward with the deletion of your client.

## Managing Users at the Client Level
