# Content Publishing

This video is going to cover content publishing including creating a new content item, publishing content items, updating existing content, and deleting content.

## Creating a New Content Item

To create a content item we will start by clicking on the Sample client card and then clicking either the plus icon in the upper right or the "Add Content Item" button.

We will then fill out the content item information for publishing. I am going to publish a reducible QlikView content item named "Sample QVW Content Item". I have to select that this is a QlikView document and then change the Reducible toggle to On. [Pop up: The reducible toggle can only be changed on creation of a content item. If a content item were to go from non reducible to reducible, a new content item would have to be created.]

I am going to upload an image, the content item, and a user guide. For a description, I will use lorem ipsum text.

After clicking on Create the Content item button, the new content will be go through virus scanning and then enter a queue (if one exists). Then it will begin publishing until it is processed.

### Publishing the Content

Once the content has been processed, we will click the green check mark on the content card. This will allow us to view the content item prior to making it live.

We must check each item off in order to attest it is the correct piece of content.

At this point, we can either approve or reject the content item. I am going to choose Approve to make this content live.

## Updating Existing Content

To update a content item, click on the green icon on the content card.

From here, we can update anything about the content item except the reducible toggle.

I am going to republish a new content item for this demo.

After clicking on "Republish" the content item is going into virus scanning. [Pop up: If you want to cancel the republishing, click the red x icon on the card]

Once the content item has been processed, we will press the go live icon.

We are going to go through and ensure the proper report was updated and then press Approve for republishing the new content.

## Deleting Content Items
