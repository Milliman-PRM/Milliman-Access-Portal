# Profit Center request policy 

The initial creation of a profit center is one of few elements of logical security within MAP that PRM is responsible for.

New profit centers in the production environment must be requested via the Profit Center Request issue template, located in the `.github` directory of this repository.  To make a request, please open an issue in this repository using that template and assign it to either a PRM Principal and/or the PRM security manager.

The request must be approved by a PRM Principal or the PRM security manager before the Profit Center is created. The request cannot be made and approved by the same person.

Additionally, the initial user assigned to the profit center must be a Milliman employee. That individual is responsible for the creation of clients and assigning users.
